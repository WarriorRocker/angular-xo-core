# Xo for Angular
Angular development made easy with WordPress

## Why choose Xo?
Xo provides a foundation for both Angular and WordPress developers to use what they know best.

1) Use WordPress to manage content for pages and posts and let Xo generate your routes dynamically.
2) Use the Xo API to get pages, posts, menus, options, and more in your Angular app.
3) Run locally using ng serve for rapid development of new features and updates.
4) Deploy for production using ng build and then distribute your theme with or without the source code.
