# Xo for Angular
Angular development made easy with WordPress

## Why choose Xo?
Xo provides a foundation for both Angular and WordPress developers to use what they know best.

1. Use WordPress to manage content for pages and posts and let Xo generate your routes dynamically.
2. Use the Xo API to get pages, posts, menus, options, and more in your Angular app.
3. Run locally using ng serve for rapid development of new features and updates.
4. Deploy for production using ng build and then distribute your theme with or without the source code.

Getting started with Xo is easy, begin with the [Getting Started](https://angularxo.io/guides) guides.

Xo also provides an extensive customization [API](https://angularxo.io/api).

## Getting Started
Getting started takes just a few minutes!

1. Add the [Xo for Angular](https://wordpress.org/plugins/xo-for-angular/) plugin to WordPress.
2. Add the [angular-xo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-xo) module to your Angular app.
3. Read the guides for [WordPress](https://angularxo.io/guides/wordpress), [Angular](https://angularxo.io/guides/angular), and [Templates](https://angularxo.io/guides/templates).

## Installation
The easiest method is directly through WordPress by searching "Xo for Angular" on the Add New plugins screen. Alternatively the latest stable release is also available for download from the [WordPress Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/xo-for-angular/) repository. 

Alternatively to use the latest development version simply clone this repository into a folder named "xo-for-angular" within your "wp-content/plugins" directory.

Run this from the plugins folder.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/WarriorRocker/angular-xo-core.git xo-for-angular
```

## Resources
The main [angularxo.io](https://angularxo.io) documentation site theme, [Angular Xo Material](https://github.com/WarriorRocker/angular-xo-material) has been provided as a complete example or base to integrating Xo with your Angular theme.
