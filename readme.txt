Modern Angular development with WordPress.

== Description ==

Xo provides a foundation for both Angular and WordPress developers to use what they know best.

1. Use WordPress to manage content for pages and posts and let Xo generate your routes dynamically.
2. Use the Xo API to get pages, posts, menus, options, and more in your Angular app.
3. Run locally using ng serve for rapid development of new features and updates.
4. Deploy for production using ng build and distribute your theme with or without the source code.

Getting started with Xo for Angular is easy, find the quick start guides [here](https://angularxo.io/guides).

Xo for Angular also provides an extensive customization API provided [here](https://angularxo.io/api). 

== Installation ==

1. Install the [angular-xo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/angular-xo/) plugin to WordPress.
2. Add the [angular-xo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-xo) module to your Angular app.
3. Build something amazing!
